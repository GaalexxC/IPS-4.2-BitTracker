*** May 1st - Back from my well deserved vacation and I feel refreshed and ready to bang the rest of this out. I am hoping for a late May release at this point. backend is pretty much done, front end Id say 75% so not much more to go before we can start testing this and iron out any bugs or missing functions.

*** This will be fully 4.3x compatible as the new IPS major version doesn't change anything to effect this app for 4.2x - 4.3x
If wholesale changes are needed for the new IPS version I will split this release and create a 4.3x version but doesn't look necessary at this time.
